## graphical drag and drop editor for espeasy rules

warning: only works in chrome

### installation

There are two options, 

1) if you have enough space on your esp (20kb) you can upload `dist/editor_inline.htm/editor.htm`
2) if you don't have enough space, but your esp has internet connection, upload `dist/editor.htm`
(all javascript files will be served using www.jsdelivr.com cdn), file size is less than 2kb in this case

- go to http://your-esp-ip/upload select the correct `editor.htm` (look into above options) and click upload. 
(ignore the warning that file must be named config.dat, also ignore the recommendation to reboot)
- once uploaded go to http://your-esp-ip/editor.htm


### using

Editor shows you the list of available nodes on your right. The list contains fixed commands and variable commands which depend on devices you have configured in espeasy.

The UI is drag and drop. Drag a node from your right side to center of the screen. When you add more nodes you can connect them. Always connect from node output to node input. Only a single connection is allowed from one ouput. Inputs can accept multiple connections.

You can move existing nodes around by drag/drop. You can delete existing nodes by right clicking on them. You can delete existing connections by right clicking in the output box (where connection starts).

Once done you can click `export chart` to see the produced rule. You can also click `save chart` which will upload rule to espeasy and also store current configuration for next time. When you come to editor the next time you will see the same configuration you saved.

### current limitations

- [ ] missing commands/features/devices (not everything from espeasy rule engine is supported)
- [ ] only a single rule (rule 1) can be edited
- [ ] only works in latest chrome
